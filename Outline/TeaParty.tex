The historical trajectory of conservatism in Congress 

Since the start of the 20th century, the ideological trajectory of the Republican Party in the United States Congress has ebbed and flowed between the moderate and conservative wings of the party. Over the last 50 years, however, the Republican Party has steadily moved to the right ideologically.


If there has not been significant changes in voting patterns or pivot points, then why do some Republicans adopt the tea party mantle? They do so to aid their election. The overwhelming majority of TP members are quality challengers and there is a huge new pool of money for Republicans to use should they
call themselves TPers. Additionally, the endorsement of these TP groups plays a powerful cue to Republican primary voters that the candidate is sufficiently conservative for that style of voters.
